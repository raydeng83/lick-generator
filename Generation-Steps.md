#Step 1
Put chord tone on the start note of each measure

#Step 2
Pick devices to use for each measure:

- Arepeggios
- Scales
- Neighboar Tone and Enclosure
- Melodic Structure

#Step 3
Add variation to each measure

- Dominant chord doesn't need to land on chord tone
- Major 7th chord land on 3, 5, 7 or 9
- Replace second strong beat with a different note in a measure

#Scales
Major 7th chord - Major(Ionian) Scale
Dominant 7th chord - Mixolydian Scale
Minor 7th chord - Dorian Scale

#Neighboar Tone and Enclosure
Neighbor tone of a target note is defined as either a half-step down from the target note (Lower Neighbor Tone, LNT), or next scale note from above (Upper Neighbor Tone, UNT). Enclosure means use both neighbor tones together, that is LNT first, then UNT, then targe note. Or, UNT first then LNT, then target note. Eventually, enclosure will always lead to target note, which is the first note of next measure.

#Melodic Structure
Melodic Structure is small cells of four note groupings from the scale that corresponding to the chord: 1-2-3-5, 1-3-4-5, 5-6-7-9, 5-7-8-9
